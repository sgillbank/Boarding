3. Select Partner Portal on the left of header.
4. Navigate to Configurations tab.
5. Click 'New Configuration' button to expand 'New Configuration' form.
6. Enter the 'Name' and select a service 'PayFabric', then put any comments in 'Description' and click 'Create' button.  A new line will be added in the configuration list.
7. Click on 'Configure PayFabric' link of the configuration package to open the setup page.
8. Change the settings as needed.  All changes made here will be applied to the invited customer during the boarding (refer to [Settings](https://github.com/PayFabric/Portal/wiki/PayFabric-Settings) for settings details).  Click 'Save Configuration' to save the changes.
9. The configuration package will not be applicable until it is published.  Click on 'Publish Configuration' link to publish it once it is ready.  You may edit your configuration package later.
